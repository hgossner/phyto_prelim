This code takes individual files from the flowcam output and concatenates them into a single file. Output file is already uploaded into data.

```{r}
# Set the folder path (change to your folder)
folder_path <- "~/Documents/UNH/Shellfish and HABs/Flowcam Data"

# List all CSV files in the folder
csv_files <- list.files(folder_path, pattern = "\\.csv$", full.names = TRUE)

# Read the first CSV file (with headers)
combined_data <- read.csv(csv_files[1])

# Loop through the remaining CSV files
for (file in csv_files[-1]) {
  # Read the CSV file, skipping the first row (header)
  temp_data <- read.csv(file, skip = 1)
  
  # Ensure the column names match the first file
  colnames(temp_data) <- colnames(combined_data)
  
  # Combine the new data with the existing combined data
  combined_data <- rbind(combined_data, temp_data)
}

# Write the combined data to a new CSV file
write.csv(combined_data, "~/Documents/UNH/Shellfish and HABs/Flowcam Data/combined_output.csv", row.names = FALSE)
```
