This variation arises from multiple factors including interspecies differences in nutritional content [@whyte1987; @menden-deuer2000], bivalve feeding strategy (selective vs. generalist) [@shumway1985; @cognie2003; @evanward2004; @beninger2005; @espinosa2010], seasonal and stochastic environmental triggers for phytoplankton germination and reproduction [@glover1985; @thompson1993; @pinckney1997; @kremp2000; @moore2008; @montresor2013], and systemic shifts in environmental parameters due to climate change [@sommer2008; @beardall2009; @winder2012; @barton2016; @henson2021].\n\nWhile considerable work has been done to map interannual phytoplankton community composition in the Gulf of Maine [@thomas2003; @moore2008; @kane2011; @record2019; @zang2021] , less has been done in New Hampshire’s Great Bay, an area with a growing shellfish aquaculture sector. The Great Bay is a well-mixed estuarine system with multiple riverine inputs. While this system has high connectivity to the Gulf of Maine, as an estuary with multiple riverine inputs, the drivers of phytoplankton community composition in estuaries are markedly different[@pinckney1997; @liu2015; @liu2018] and regional understanding of both seasonal cycles and future predictions is likely not fully accurate.\n\nIn order to better understand the local phytoplankton community and therefore their nutritional availability of commercially valuable bivalves, this project utilizes a weekly time series of Flowcam imagery to examine changes in community composition on both an annual and interannual time scale from two locations in the Great Bay estuary. Refinement of this data pipeline will allow us to see in nearly real time what changes are occurring within the local phytoplankton community in order to provide more timely information on harmful algal species and nutritional availability to both managers and shellfish aquaculture stakeholders.\n\n# Methods\n\nData was collected weekly at multiple sites throughout the Great Bay Estuary and the New Hampshire Seacoast starting in October, 2020. Three sites (@fig-map) were focused on due to their completeness and relevance to understanding the system- Hampton (North Beach, Hampton, NH; 42.90172˚N, 70.809117˚W) University of New Hampshire (UNH) Coastal Marine Lab (CML) (New Castle, NH; 43.091613˚N, 70.710670˚W), and Jackson Estuarine Lab (JEL) (Adam’s Point, Durham, NH; 43.092114˚N, 70.864097˚W). Along with date, tide time was generally recorded. Samples taken at both CML and JEL were taken within thirty minutes before or fifteen minutes after slack high tide.\n\n![Map of Sampling Sites](images/phyto_sampling_map.png){#fig-map}\n\nChlorophyll was measured as in @anderson2018. Briefly, 50-100mL of seawater were passed over 25mm 0.7mm GF/F filters. Filters were then placed in a 91% ethanol solution and left in the dark for 12-24 hours to extract chlorophyll, then samples were measured on a Turner AU10 fluorometer [@jesperson1987; @graff2011]. Samples post-2022 were corrected for phaophytin.\n\nTriplicate 5mL sample aliquots were preserved with 0.5% glutaraldehyde, incubated at 4˚C for 10 minutes, and then stored at -80˚C until analysis (not more than 3 weeks) [@handbook2019]. These samples were then  analyzed for particle size distribution using flow cytometry (Guava easyCyte HT, Millipore), again based on @anderson2018 , at a low flow rate (0.24mL s^-1^) for three minutes to acquire cell counts for picoeukaryotes, nanoeukaryotes, and cyanobacteria. These three groups were identified based on the relationship between forward scatter vs. orange or red florescence signals [@worden2003].\n\nAn additional portion of the sample (100-200mL, preserved in 1% formalin) was run through a FlowCam (Model 8100-C, Yokogawa Fluid Imaging technologies, Maine, USA) in order to capture data on the larger cells (20-200mm). Before scanning, samples were filtered through 200mm mesh to remove the particles outside the size-range of interest. Triplicate 5-10mL samples were run on Autoimage mode at 4x magnification through a 300mm flow cell at 2 mL min^-1^. Data was processed using in-built software Visual Spreadsheet 6 to separate out individual particle vignettes and associated data describing size, color, transparency, and symmetry.\n\nAll data processing was done using R v. 4.4.0 (R Core Team, 2020). A subset of the time series was selected for analysis based on completeness of data ranging from May 2023 through October 2024. First, the relationship between chlorophyll levels and cell count from both the flow cytometer and the Flowcam were examined visually, considering differences both by location and cell size. Simple linear regressions were built internally to ggplot2 (@ggplot2) using the geom_smooth function, and equations were estimated and printed using ggpmisc (@ggpmisc) function stat_poly_eq. Next, a PCA was conducted on the Flowcam data using FactoMineR and factoextra to assess potential groupings and effect sizes of parameters included in the output [@factoextra; @FactoMineR]. An exploratory heatmap of parameter correlations was created using package pheatmap (@pheatmap). Lastly, a generalized linear model was fit to the data to determine which phytoplankton image parameters best track chlorophyll concentration.\n\n# Results\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code .hidden}\n## Call required packages\nrequire(dplyr)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr .hidden}\n\n```\nLoading required package: dplyr\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr .hidden}\n\n```\n\nAttaching package: 'dplyr'\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr .hidden}\n\n```\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:stats':\n\n    filter, lag\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr .hidden}\n\n```\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:base':\n\n    intersect, setdiff, setequal, union\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code .hidden}\nlibrary(rprojroot)\nrequire(tidyverse)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr .hidden}\n\n```\nLoading required package: tidyverse\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr .hidden}\n\n```\n── Attaching core tidyverse packages ──────────────────────── tidyverse 2.0.0 ──\n✔ forcats   1.0.0     ✔ readr     2.1.5\n✔ ggplot2   3.5.1     ✔ stringr   1.5.1\n✔ lubridate 1.9.3     ✔ tibble    3.2.1\n✔ purrr     1.0.2     ✔ tidyr     1.3.1\n── Conflicts ────────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse_conflicts() ──\n✖ dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter()\n✖ dplyr::lag()    masks stats::lag()\nℹ Use the conflicted package (<http://conflicted.r-lib.org/>) to force all conflicts to become errors\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code .hidden}\nrequire(ggplot2)\nrequire(ggpmisc)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr .hidden}\n\n```\nLoading required package: ggpmisc\nLoading required package: ggpp\nRegistered S3 methods overwritten by 'ggpp':\n  method                  from   \n  heightDetails.titleGrob ggplot2\n  widthDetails.titleGrob  ggplot2\n\nAttaching package: 'ggpp'\n\nThe following object is masked from 'package:ggplot2':\n\n    annotate\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code .hidden}\nrequire(MetBrewer)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr .hidden}\n\n```\nLoading required package: MetBrewer\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code .hidden}\nrequire(stringr)\nlibrary(FactoMineR)\nlibrary(factoextra)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr .hidden}\n\n```\nWelcome!

The numeric parameters were averaged over location and date in order to simplify the model. The model was further reduced to eliminate non-significant coefficients for an final fit of chlorphyll as a function of diameter, season, and location (Table 2) (AIC=119.89). The chlorophyll at JEL is on average 1.468 ± 0.24 $\\mu$g/L (p= \\<0.0001) higher than at CML. Spring chlorophyll concentrations are estimated to be 1.069 ± 0.25$\\mu$g/L (p= 0.00015) higher than fall, and summer chlorophyll 0.687 ± 0.22$\\mu$g/L (p=0.00354).

The highly-estuarine site JEL frequently shows elevated chlorophyll concentrations relative to coastal-adjacent CML, with differences as high a factor of magnitude. CML is also interesting in that its bloom peaks seem to be on average lower than either HAMP or JEL. HAMP also exhibits a fair amount of variability, but its high-est annual concentrations in the available data seem to be the fall blooms in both 2023 and 2024. Fall tends to be a smaller, secondary bloom which is triggered by the increased mix depth due to the breaking up of water column stratification at the end of summer, rather than the spring bloom which is triggered by light and temperature. It would be helpful to examine environmental parameters from these three locations to get a better sense of what physical factors might be driving these changes. It would also be interesting to collect finer resolution chlorophyll concentration data on either a daily-tidal or even hourly timescale.\n\nAnother important consideration with the chlorophyll data is that not all of the bulk chlorophyll measured may be coming from a living source. It is possible that the chlorophyll is associated with dead primary producers in detritus which have not broken down enough yet to change the detectable composition of chlorophyll. Future plans for this dataset include adding identification to all particles which will allow us to filter out any non-living individuals from analysis.\n\nFor the smaller size classes of phytoplankton, all three size classes also showed high rates of variability on a weekly time scale. Picoeukaryotes had on average the highest overall concentration over the course of the year with peaks in summer and fall, perhaps slightly lagged behind the main chlorophyll peak. Cyanobacteria had their highest relative concentration peak in the middle of winter, perhaps due to some alleviation of competition during the winter lull in overall productivity. Nanoeukaryotes had relatively low concentration compared to the other two groups, but this may be partially due to a sampling artifact as they tend to fall on the lower end of detection size-wise. While these comparisons may be interesting, there was unfortunately no correlation between the small cells and chlorophyll either broken down by location ($\\text{R}^2$ = 0.05 for both) or by size class ($\\text{R}^2$ = 0.16, \\<0.01, and 0.05 for cyanobacteria, nanoeukaryotes, and picoeukaryotes, respectively). This shows that any signal due to the smaller cells is likely being swamped by blooms of larger individuals like diatoms. Again, future identification of particles and cross-reference between Flowcam and flow cytometer data will better elucidate this relationship.\n\nThe preliminary analysis of parameter relationships was fairly unsurprising, with lots of correlations signifying it will likely be easy to reduce the amount of variables necessary for an effective model. Similar parameters tended to be calculated with some unifying calculation (e.g., color, describing circle-based measurements, measures of area/diameter). The most interesting part of the PCA actually turned out to be the pattern of the individual data points and how they group on PC1 vs. PC2 (@fig-pca-ind). It appears as though there is a core grouping around the (0,0) which does not change seasonally. This again may be due to characteristics of detritus in the water rather than living phytoplankton, so this figure will be interesting to revisit after creating a classification filter. There does visually appear to be differences between seasons which may intensify after removing detritus.\n\nDue to complications with the model, the data was simplified by averaging characteristics and modeled as mean bulk chlorophyll as a function of location, season, and diameter. Model fitting procedure showed that when averaged, mean diameter was the only imaging parameter (from the reduced subset chosen to test) that had any significance. This could possibly be due to that core grouping of individuals around the origin in the individual PCA plot; the weight of the core “blob” could be outweighing outliers (potentially the larger, living phytoplankton). The fact that season and location were significant factors was unsurprising judging by the visual assessment of data distribution. It will be extremely interesting to see what happens with a more complex model, hopefully one with a random effect for date-location and better accounting for multiple-sampling.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nThis preliminary exploration of phytoplankton community composition data in the Great Bay shows several important things to consider in future analysis. First, small size phytoplankton, while ecologically interesting, do not contribute significantly to bulk chlorophyll measurements, meaning that they can be ignored in models for now. Second, there appears to be a core grouping of particle images from the Flowcam which, when averaged, swamp statistical differences in imaging parameters from “outliers”. If this group is indeed detrital, classification and filtering of these particles is essential for better modeling the relationship between particle images and chlorophyll. Overall, this analysis emphasizes the need for classification in high throughput imaging studies in order to handle non-target particles.\n\n#Works Cited\n",
